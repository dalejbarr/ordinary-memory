How do speakers produce referential descriptions that satisfy
addressees’ informational needs during real-time conversation?  A recent
proposal is that ordinary memory processes can serve as a proxy for the
consideration of common ground.  But this is only possible if speakers
encode and access sufficiently detailed memory representations.  We
tested this proposal by having speakers describe referents in contexts
varying in perceptual similarity to previous contexts in the
dialogue. Based on the analysis of a total of 4,817 descriptions from
112 speakers over three experiments, we found little evidence that
contextual similarity modulated the informational content of speakers’
descriptions, regardless of whether that similarity was based on
configurational cues (Exps. 1 and 2), or on the perceptual experience of
interacting with a conversational partner (Exp. 3).  In contrast,
speakers did modulate their descriptions when their beliefs about the
addressee changed, even when the perceptual match between encoding and
retrieval contexts was identical.  This suggests that the episodic
representations accessed during message generation may be too
impoverished to serve as an effective proxy for common ground.
